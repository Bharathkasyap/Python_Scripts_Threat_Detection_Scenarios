üõ°Ô∏è Python Script Library for Proactive Cyber Threat Hunting and Remediation
üìñ Introduction
In today's evolving threat landscape, proactive threat hunting is indispensable for identifying and neutralizing sophisticated malicious activities that bypass traditional security defenses. This practice involves meticulously sifting through system and network logs, parsing vast amounts of event data, and identifying subtle behavioral anomalies indicative of compromise.

Python scripting empowers cybersecurity analysts and threat hunters to significantly enhance their capabilities by automating repetitive analysis tasks, rapidly parsing diverse log formats, enriching threat indicators, and even simulating attack or response scenarios. When combined with powerful Bash terminal execution, these scripts can be seamlessly deployed across endpoints or centrally managed for comprehensive investigative and remedial actions.

This repository features a curated collection of 30 Python scripts, meticulously categorized by common threat detection and response use cases. These scripts are designed to equip security professionals with practical tools to:

Parse and analyze critical security logs: Including Sysmon, DNS, Windows Event Logs, and Email logs.

Detect early indicators of compromise (IOCs): Identifying suspicious patterns before they escalate.

Monitor for advanced attack techniques: Such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, and persistence mechanisms.

Automate the investigation and initial response to suspicious activities.

üöÄ Script Catalog
Below is a detailed catalog of the scripts included in this library, outlining their primary objective, ideal use cases, and execution instructions. Each script is designed for practical application in real-world threat hunting scenarios.

suspicious_parents = ["winword.exe", "excel.exe", "outlook.exe"]
suspicious_children = ["cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "wscript.exe"]

matches = df[
    df["ParentImage"].isin(suspicious_parents) &
    df["Image"].isin(suspicious_children)
]
